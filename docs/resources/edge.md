# echostream_edge (Resource)

[Edges](https://docs.echo.stream/docs/edges) transmit messages of a single MessageType between Nodes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "echostream_timer_node" "timer" {
  name                = "timer"
  schedule_expression = "15 * ? * * *"
}

resource "echostream_load_balancer_node" "lb1" {
  name                 = "lb1"
  receive_message_type = "echo.timer"
}

resource "echostream_edge" "timer_to_lb1" {
  source = data.echostream_timer_node.timer.name
  target = echostream_load_balancer_node.lb1.name
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `source` (String) The source Node to transmit messages from.
- `target` (String) The target Node to transmit messages to.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A human-readable description.
- `kmskey` (String) The name of the KmsKey to use to encrypt the message at rest and in flight. Defaults to the Tenant's KmsKey.
- `max_receive_count` (Number) The maximum number of delivbery tries to the `target`. `0` is the default and will try forever. Any positive number will result in that many tries before sending the messagge to the `DeadLetterEmitterNode`.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) The ARN of the underlying AWS SQS Queue.
- `message_type` (String) The MessageType that will be transmitted.
- `queue` (String) The URL of the underlying AWS SQS queue.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import echostream_edge.my_edge "source_name|target_name"
```
