<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the Node. Must be unique within the Tenant.

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) The Files.com api key. Used by this node to obtain a whitelist of IP addresses from Files.com.

!> **Warning:** While this attribute is marked as Optional to support the importation of these resources, it is *Required* for creating them.
- `description` (String) A human-readable description.

### Read-Only

- `endpoint` (String) The Webhooks endpoint to forward Files.com webhooks events to. Accepts all version of Files.com webhook events at the root path.
- `send_message_type` (String) The MessageType that this Node is capable of sending.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) The token for the event endpoint. Files.com doesn't support real Webhooks security, so we add a token that is to be sent in the webhook in the headers. Place this token as the value for the `Authorization` header, prepending it with `Bearer`. For example, if token was `12345` then the header would be `Authorization: Bearer 12345`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import echostream_files_dot_com_webhook_node.files "node_name"
```
